## Why
ThreatModeler is the most advanced threat modeling platform on the market and leverages process flow diagramming (PFD) with Visual, Agile, Simple, Threat Modeling (VAST) methodology.  In order to maximize threat model analysis, DevSecOps requires enough contextualization of applications, shared infrastructure components and their interactions. Data flow diagram-based threat models only describe the data flows between components and provide a genericized visual representation. After constructing the DFD-based threat model, security SMEs check the application against the STRIDE threat model classification scheme; which is high level and does not provide the granular, contextual insights needed to make informed security decisions.   

## What
Process flow diagram-based threat modeling represents the mature visual decomposition of modern IT applications and infrastructure. PFD-based threat models go beyond DFD’s to allow deeper contextual information about specific components and not just component types. PFDs were specifically designed to illustrate the attacker’s perspective and path to data targets. The VAST methodology utilizes the PFD threat modeling approach.   http://www.threatmodeler.com/

Tool 1: Threatmodeler by Stuart Winter-Tear, Alex Bauert and Nikunj Nagalia

## Outcomes
Implementing the VAST methodology ensures contextualization between all elements for accurate threat mitigation at scale. This leads to a reduction of false positives and false negatives as well as the implementation of security controls that address real threats. Apply the VAST methodology and execute process flow diagram-based threat modeling seamlessly with ThreatModeler’s automated platform. This proactive and collaborative approach reduces security debt, maximizing efficiency and ROI. 

ThreatModeler is contributing its industry leading technology to embolden the DevSecOps community to continuously prioritize the protection of their applications – at no cost. ThreatModeler’s Community Edition can be accessed via https://community.threatmodeler.net. It enables developers to upload TMT Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) files for automatic conversion into Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) to  uncover all IT environment threats in minutes. DevSecOps can use the insights gained from the threat report to confidently build security into their code.

A recoroding of the demo will be made available.
